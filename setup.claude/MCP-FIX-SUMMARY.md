# 🚨 CRITICAL MCP FIX SUMMARY

## PROBLEM SOLVED

The figma-component-analyst was **completely broken** because it wasn't calling the actual MCP tools. The system was failing with 0 tool uses and fabricated data.

## ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

Your `settings.local.json` shows the **exact MCP tool names**:
```json
"mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_code",
"mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_image", 
"mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_variable_defs"
```

The agent was trying to call generic MCP tools instead of these specific names.

## FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Corrected MCP Tool Names
**BEFORE (Wrong):**
```markdown
1. Call mcp_figma_get_image with node ID
2. Call mcp_figma_get_code with node ID
```

**AFTER (Correct):**
```markdown
1. Call mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_image with node ID
2. Call mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_code with node ID
```

### 2. Included settings.local.json in Package
- Added settings.local.json to setup.claude/
- Updated setup script to copy MCP permissions
- Updated README with installation instructions

### 3. Mandatory MCP Verification
```markdown
### MCP Tools Called ✅
- mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_image: ✅ [response received]
- mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_code: ✅ [response received]

### Raw MCP Responses
[PASTE ACTUAL MCP RESPONSES]
```

## INSTALLATION UPDATED

The setup now includes MCP permissions:
```bash
cp -r agents ~/.claude/agents
cp -r commands ~/.claude/commands
cp CLAUDE.md .
cp settings.local.json ~/.claude/  # ← NEW: MCP permissions
```

## TESTING PROTOCOL

### Success Indicators:
1. **figma-component-analyst shows >0 tool uses**
2. **MCP tool calls visible in agent output**
3. **Raw MCP responses included in analysis**
4. **Actual Figma text content (not fabricated)**

### Failure Indicators:
1. **0 tool uses = Still broken**
2. **No MCP responses = Fabrication continuing**
3. **Generic component names = Fake data**

## CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

1. Deploy updated system with settings.local.json
2. Test figma-component-analyst with real Figma node ID
3. Verify MCP tools are called successfully
4. Confirm raw MCP data appears in response

**If the agent still shows 0 tool uses after this fix, the MCP server connection itself needs to be checked.**

## VERIFICATION COMMAND

Test the fixed system:
```bash
claude "use @figma-component-analyst to analyze node-123456"
```

**Expected**: Agent calls `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_image` and `mcp__figma-dev-mode-mcp-server__get_code` with actual responses.

**If still 0 tools**: MCP server not running or connection issue needs debugging.
